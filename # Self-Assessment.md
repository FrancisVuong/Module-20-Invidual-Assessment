# Self-Assessment

## Role(s)
- The role in the team that I took was primarily a facilitator role.
- The secondary job I had was to help on the machine learning components, mostly research and testing different algorithms. 
- I gave direction to the group for the project, coming up with the project idea and steps we should take to get there in a broad scope. The team really pulled through on those ideas that I had and really narrowed down on the specifics to execute them.

## Contribution
- Idea generation.
- Primary spokes person.
- Machine Learning Algorithms. 
- Team direction/ Clearing up the big picture. 

## Personal Challenges
- Personally I would have liked to contribute a bit more on the coding side of things, but the team members who took charge of that really pulled through on that end so I didn't have to dive to deep into that. I helped out where and when I could have of course but it was mostly finishing touches and testing different methods. 


# Team Assessment

## Communication
- The general communication on the team, although good, I perhaps could have made a bit more effort in facilitating more conversations throughout the week. Whenever someone needed some help there was little hisetation to ask, I tried to help in anyway I could and it was the same for the rest of the team. 

## Strengths
- Everyone did their tasks to the best of there ability and was done mostly on an individual bases. 
- The teamwork and colaboration between members was fantastic, when we met on class days everyone gave some input to piece together the project day by day. 
- Everyone supported each others ideas as long as it was feesable.
- The supportive aspect of the team was extremely good for team moral, anytime someone took charge of a task, everyone supported them in anyway they could, whether it was an grand idea or storyboard layouts.  
- Our progress throughout the weeks was also fantastic, everyone managed their time/deadlines very well and any last minute adjustments were handle gracefully. 

# Summary of Project
- We created a simple interface that predicted a winner between two NBA teams. Given data from previous seasons to train a model and more recent data, up to current date, to accurately present the outcome. 
- Data was pulled from the official NBA website with an API and stored in an AWS server. We pulled the data from the AWS server through postgres SQL and then created dataframes to use in the Machine Learning models. 

## Topics Addressed 
- Data Retrieval 
- Data Storage 
- Data Exploration and Visualization
- Machine Learning
- Dashboard Design
- Webapp interface creation

## Machine Module used
- Primary Machine Learning Model used was the RandomForest. This model gave us the best results in terms of accuracy. 
- We also tried a Logistic regression, Decision Tree Model as well as some Neural Network was attempted. 

## Results of the analysis 
- We managed to put together the webapp before the presentation day.It is functional, however I doubt the accuracy of the output unfortunetally. 
- Given more time, we could have dove deeper into the machine learning models and increased the accuracy to a more trust worthy level. Things we could have changed are adding additional factors into the models. As well as perhaps finding a more suitable model for the given circumstance to try. 
- The rest of the project went very well in my opinion, given the amount of time we had to create the final product as well, I am very pleased with the turn out. 
- Of course everything can be improved given more time but given that its our first project together and we just learned most of the things we did on this project not to long ago I think we did a fantastic job.
